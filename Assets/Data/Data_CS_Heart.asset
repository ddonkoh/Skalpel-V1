  description: "Your heart is divided into four chambers. You have two chambers on
    the top (atrium, plural atria) and two on the bottom (ventricles), one on each
    side of the heart. \r\n\r\nRight atrium: Two large veins deliver oxygen-poor
    blood to your right atrium. The superior vena cava carries blood from your upper
    body. The inferior vena cava brings blood from the lower body. Then the right
    atrium pumps the blood to your right ventricle. \r\n\r\nRight ventricle: The
    lower right chamber pumps the oxygen-poor blood to your lungs through the pulmonary
    artery. The lungs reload blood with oxygen. \r\n\r\nLeft atrium: After the lungs
    fill blood with oxygen, the pulmonary veins carry the blood to the left atrium.
    This upper chamber pumps the blood to your left ventricle. \r\n\r\nLeft ventricle:
    The left ventricle is slightly larger than the right. It pumps oxygen-rich blood
    to the rest of your body. "
