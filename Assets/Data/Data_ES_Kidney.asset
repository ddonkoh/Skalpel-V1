  description: "The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs that are roughly the size
    of a fist. A tough, fibrous renal capsule surrounds each kidney and provides
    support for the soft tissue inside. Beyond that, two layers of fat serve as further
    protection. The adrenal glands lie on top of the kidneys. \r\n\r\nInside the
    kidneys are a number of pyramid-shaped lobes. Each consists of an outer renal
    cortex and an inner renal medulla. Nephrons flow between these sections. Each
    nephron includes a filter, called the glomerulus, and a tubule. The glomerulus
    filters blood, which enters the kidneys through the renal arteries and leaves
    through the renal veins. The kidneys are relatively small organs, but they receive
    20\u201325%Trusted Source of the heart\u2019s output. \r\n\r\nThe tubule returns
    necessary substances to the blood and removes waste that then becomes urine.
    The kidneys excrete urine through the ureter, a tube that leads to the bladder. "
