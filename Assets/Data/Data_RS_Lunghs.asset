  description: "The lungs are a pair of spongy, air-filled organs located on either
    side of the chest (thorax). The trachea (windpipe) conducts inhaled air into
    the lungs through its tubular branches, called bronchi. The bronchi then divide
    into smaller and smaller branches (bronchioles), finally becoming microscopic.
    \r\n\r\nThe bronchioles eventually end in clusters of microscopic air sacs called
    alveoli. In the alveoli, oxygen from the air is absorbed into the blood. Carbon
    dioxide, a waste product of metabolism, travels from the blood to the alveoli,
    where it can be exhaled. Between the alveoli is a thin layer of cells called
    the interstitium, which contains blood vessels and cells that help support the
    alveoli. \r\n\r\nThe lungs are covered by a thin tissue layer called the pleura.
    The same kind of thin tissue lines the inside of the chest cavity -- also called
    pleura. A thin layer of fluid acts as a lubricant allowing the lungs to slip
    smoothly as they expand and contract with each breath. "
