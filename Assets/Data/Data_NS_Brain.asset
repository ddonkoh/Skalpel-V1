  description: "The brain is one of the largest and most complex organs in the human
    body. \r\nIt is made up of more than 100 billion nerves that communicate in trillions
    of connections called synapses. \r\n \r\nThe brain is made up of many specialized
    areas that work together: \r\n\u2022 The cortex is the outermost layer of brain
    cells. Thinking and voluntary movements begin in the cortex. \r\n\u2022 The brain
    stem is between the spinal cord and the rest of the brain. Basic functions like
    breathing and sleep are controlled here. \r\n\u2022 The basal ganglia are a cluster
    of structures in the center of the brain. The basal ganglia coordinate messages
    between multiple other brain areas. \r\n\u2022 The cerebellum is at the base
    and the back of the brain. The cerebellum is responsible for coordination and
    balance. \r\n \r\nThe brain is also divided into several lobes: \r\n\u2022 The
    frontal lobes are responsible for problem solving and judgment and motor function.
    \r\n\u2022 The parietal lobes manage sensation, handwriting, and body position.
    \r\n\u2022 The temporal lobes are involved with memory and hearing. \r\n\u2022
    The occipital lobes contain the brain's visual processing system. \r\n\r\nThe
    brain is surrounded by a layer of tissue called the meninges. The skull (cranium)
    helps protect the brain from injury. "
