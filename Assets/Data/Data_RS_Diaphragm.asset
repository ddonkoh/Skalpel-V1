  description: "The diaphragm is a double-domed musculotendinous sheet, located at
    the inferior-most aspect of the rib cage. It serves two main functions: \r\n\r\nSeparates
    the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity (the word diaphragm is derived
    from the Greek \u2018di\xE1phragma\u2019, meaning partition). \r\n\r\nUndergoes
    contraction and relaxation, altering the volume of the thoracic cavity and the
    lungs, producing inspiration and expiration. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe diaphragm is
    the primary muscle of respiration. During inspiration, it contracts and flattens,
    increasing the vertical diameter of the thoracic cavity. This produces lung expansion,
    and air is drawn in. During expiration, the diaphragm passively relaxes and returns
    to its original dome shape. This reduces the volume of the thoracic cavity. "
