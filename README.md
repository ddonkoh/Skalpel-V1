4. **Load the Main Scene:**
   - Once the project is open in Unity, navigate to the `Assets` folder in the Project pane.
   - Look for the main scene file (it might be named something like `MainScene.unity` or similar). Double-click on it to load the scene.

5. **Run the Project:**
   - Press the `Play` button at the top center of the Unity window to run the project in the editor.

6. **Build and Deploy (Optional):**
   - If you wish to build and deploy the project to a device or create an executable, go to `File > Build Settings`, select your target platform, and follow the prompts to build and deploy.

### Troubleshooting:
